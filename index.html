          <header id="first">What is HTML?</header>
          <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is not a programming language. It is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page, italicize words, and so on.  For example, consider the following line of text:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>My cat is very grumpy<p>
          </div>
          <p>If we wanted the text to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in a paragraph <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> element:</span>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;
          </div>
          <div class="note-p-div p-color-div">
            <p><span class="note-text">Note</span>:Tags in HTML are case-insensitive. This means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase. For example, a <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong> tag could be written as <strong>&lt;title&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;TITLE&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;Title&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</strong>, etc., and it will work. However, it is best practice to write all tags in lowercase for consistency and readability.</p>
          </div>

        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element">
          <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
          <p>Let's further explore our paragraph element from the previous section:</p>
          <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/K82sBTF5/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="Anatomy Image" id="anatomy-img">
          <p>The anatomy of our element is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this example, p for paragraph), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This opening tag marks where the element begins or starts to take effect. In this example, it precedes the start of the paragraph text.</li>
            <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element. In this example, it is the paragraph text.</li>
            <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This marks where the element ends. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error that can produce peculiar results.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The element is the opening tag, followed by content, followed by the closing tag.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_elements">
          <header>Nesting elements</header>
          <p>Elements can be placed within other elements. This is called <em>nesting</em>. If we wanted to state that our cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy, we could wrap the word very in a <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> element, which means that the word is to have strong(er) text formatting:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;<p>
          </div>
          <p>There is a right and wrong way to do nesting. In the example above, we opened the <strong>p</strong> element first, then opened the <strong>strong</strong> element. For proper nesting, we should close the <strong>strong</strong> element first, before closing the <strong>p</strong>.</p>
          <p>The following is an example of the wrong way to do nesting:</p>
          <div class="red-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;<p>
          </div>
          <p>The <strong>tags have to open and close in a way that they are inside or outside one another</strong>. With the kind of overlap in the example above, the browser has to guess at your intent. This kind of guessing can result in unexpected results.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Block_versus_inline_elements">
          <header>Block versus inline elements</header>
          <p>There are two important categories of elements to know in HTML: block-level elements and inline elements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Block-level elements form a visible block on a page. A block-level element appears on a new line following the content that precedes it. Any content that follows a block-level element also appears on a new line. Block-level elements are usually structural elements on the page. For example, a block-level element might represent headings, paragraphs, lists, navigation menus, or footers. A block-level element wouldn't be nested inside an inline element, but it might be nested inside another block-level element.</li>
            <li>Inline elements are contained within block-level elements, and surround only small parts of the documentâ€™s content (not entire paragraphs or groupings of content). An inline element will not cause a new line to appear in the document. It is typically used with text, for example an <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> element creates a hyperlink, and elements such as <strong>&lt;em&gt;</strong> or <strong>&lt;strong&gt;</strong> create emphasis.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="note-p-div p-color-div">
            <p><span class="note-text">Note</span>: The terms block and inline, as used in this article, should not be confused with the types of CSS boxes that have the same names. While the names correlate by default, changing the CSS display type doesn't change the category of the element, and doesn't affect which elements it can contain and which elements it can be contained in. One reason HTML5 dropped these terms was to prevent this rather common confusion.<p>
          </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Empty_elements">
          <header>Empty elements</header>
          <p>Not all elements follow the pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist of a single tag, which is typically used to insert/embed something in the document. For example, the <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> element embeds an image file onto a page:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png"&gt;<p>
          </div>
          <div class="note-p-div p-color-div">
            <p><span class="note-text">Note</span>: Empty elements are sometimes called <em>void elements</em>.<p>
          </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Attributes">
          <header>Attributes</header>
          <p>Elements can also have attributes. Attributes look like this:</p>
          <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/JnxPNYr3/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="Attribute Illustration Image">
          <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content. In this example, the <strong>class</strong> attribute is an identifying name used to target the element with style information.</p>
          <p>An attribute should have:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A space between it and the element name. (For an element with more than one attribute, the attributes should be separated by spaces too.)</li>
            <li>The attribute name, followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>An attribute value, wrapped with opening and closing quote marks.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Another example of an element is <a>. This stands for anchor. An anchor can make the text it encloses into a hyperlink. Anchors can take a number of attributes, but several are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>href:</strong> This attribute's value specifies the web address for the link. For example: <strong>href="https://www.mozilla.org/"</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>title:</strong> The </strong>title</strong> attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as a description of the page that is being linked to. For example, <strong>title="The Mozilla homepage"</strong>. This appears as a tooltip when a cursor hovers over the element.</li>
    <li><strong>target:</strong> The <strong>target</strong> attribute specifies the browsing context used to display the link. For example, <strong>target="_blank"</strong> will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the linked content in the current tab, just omit this attribute.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Boolean_attributes">
          <header>Boolean attributes</header>
          <p>Sometimes you will see attributes written without values. This is entirely acceptable. These are called <em>Boolean attributes</em>. Boolean attributes can only have one value, which is generally the same as the attribute name. For example, consider the <strong>disabled attribute</strong>, which you can assign to form input elements. (You use this to disable the form input elements so the user can't make entries. The <strong>disabled elements</strong> typically have a grayed-out appearance.) For example:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;input type="text" disabled="disabled"&gt;</p>
          </div>
          <p>As shorthand, it is acceptable to write this as follows:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p><span class="comment-text">&lt;!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box --&gt;</span><br>
&lt;input type="text" disabled&gt;</p>
            <p><span class="comment-text">&lt;!-- text input is allowed, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute --&gt;</span><br>
&lt;input type="text"&gt;</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Single_or_double_quotes?">
          <header>Single or double quotes?</header>
          <p>In this article you will also notice that the attributes are wrapped in double quotes. However, you might see single quotes in some HTML code. This is a matter of style. You can feel free to choose which one you prefer. Both of these lines are equivalent:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
            <p>&lt;a href='https://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
          </div>
          <p>Make sure you don't mix single quotes and double quotes. This example (below) shows a kind of mixing quotes that will go wrong:</p>
          <div class="red-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
          </div>
          <p>However, if you use one type of quote, you can include the other type of quote inside your attribute values:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;a href="https://www.example.com" title="Isn't this fun?"&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
          </div>
          <p>To use quote marks inside other quote marks of the same type (single quote or double quote), use HTML entities. For example, this will break:</p>
          <div class="red-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;a href='https://www.example.com' title='Isn't this fun?'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
          </div>
          <p>Instead, you need to do this:</p>
          <div class="blue-p-div p-color-div">
            <p>&lt;a href='https://www.example.com' title='Isn&apos(;)t this fun?'&gt;A link to my example.&lt;/a&gt;</p>
          </div>
